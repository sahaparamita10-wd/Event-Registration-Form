# Event-Registration-Form

This Event Registration Form is a simple and user-friendly web-based form created using HTML. The purpose of this project is to collect participants details for registering in different types of events such as workshops, conferences and seminars. The form is divided into multiple sections to ensure organized data collection. The Personal Information section gathers essential user details like full name, email address, contact number and date of birth etc. The Event Details section allows users to select the type of event, choose their preferred attendance mode (online or offline) and indicate the sessions they are interested in (morning, afternoon or evening). An additional section is provided for comments or queries. Basic CSS styling is used to improve readability and layout. The form also includes Reset and Submit buttons for better usability.
